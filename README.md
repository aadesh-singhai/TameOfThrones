## Problem Context - <a href="https://www.geektrust.in/coding-problem/backend/tame-of-thrones">Tame of Thrones</a>.
Coding challenge is to have a King send secret message to each kingdom and win them over.
Once he wins 3 more kingdoms, he is the ruler! The secret message needs to contain the letters of the animal in their emblem.
For example, secret message to the Land kingdom (emblem: Panda) needs to have the letter 'p','n','d' at-least once and 'a' atleast twice. If he sends "ahdvvnxxxautup" to the Land kingdom, he will win them over.
King Shan wants to make sure his secret message is not found by his enemies easily. So he decides to use the oldest of the
ciphers 'Seasar cipherâ€™.
